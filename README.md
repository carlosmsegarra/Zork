#Zork v1.0

The author of this Zork version is myself, Carlos Martinez.

 The instructions are very simple:
-You can move in the map with the commands north/south/east/west and n/s/e/w

-To exit the program you have to write the command 'exit' when the game asks which direction do you want to go.

-If you are lost check the map that I have in my Github :)

-To open a door just answer yes or y when the question 'do you want to open the door' appears on the screen.


I hope that you enjoy playing the game!!! :))
